General discussion on ordinary differential equations.

Introducing Julia.

**Note**: v0.7 and v1.0 released on 8/8/2018 introduces many breaking
changes. So there is a bit learning curve if you are somewhat familiar
with previous versions of Julia before. I compiled a few things below I
noticed when migrating my old code snippets and notebooks used in the
lecture in this [pdf file](https://github.com/lin-lin/MATH228A/blob/master/others/JuliaChange_v0.7.pdf).

Here is a notebook introducing some basic features of Julia.
